# Module 2: Microsoft Azure management tools
# Lab: Using Microsoft Azure management tools
  
### Scenario
  
To prepare for the deployment of Azure services, you want to become familiar with the primary Azure management tools. Most of your on-premises administrative tasks are automated by means of PowerShell scripts and Linux shell scripts. You have decided to test the use of Azure PowerShell and the Azure CLI.


### Objectives
  
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Install the Azure PowerShell modules and the Azure CLI.
- Use Azure PowerShell and the Azure CLI to connect to your Azure subscription.
- Run Azure PowerShell cmdlets and Azure CLI commands targeting your Azure subscriptions.

    > **Note**: The lab steps for this course change frequently due to updates to Microsoft Azure. Microsoft Learning updates the lab steps frequently, so they are not available in this manual. Your instructor will provide you with the lab documentation.

### Lab Setup
  
Estimated Time: **30 minutes**

Virtual machine: **10979F-MIA-CL1**

User name: **Admin**

Password: **Pa55w.rd**

For this lab, you need to use the available virtual machine environment. Before you begin the lab, you must complete the following steps:

1. On the host computer, start **Hyper-V Manager**.

1. In Hyper-V Manager, click **10979F-MIA-CL1**, and then in the Actions pane, click **Start**.

1. In the Actions pane, click **Connect**. Wait until the virtual machine starts. 

1. Sign in by using the following credentials: 

    - User name: **Admin**

    - Password: **Pa55w.rd**

1. You also need to start **MT17B-WS2016-NAT** for Internet access.


## Exercise 1: Using the Azure PowerShell modules
  
### Scenario
  
In this exercise, you will use the Azure PowerShell modules.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Install the Azure PowerShell modules

1. Connect to your Azure subscription

1. Use Azure PowerShell cmdlets


#### Task 1: Install the Azure PowerShell modules
  
1. On MIA-CL1, start Microsoft Edge, and then browse to [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/). 

1. Use the Azure PowerShell link on the Downloads page to browse to the **Install the Azure PowerShell module** page and review the requirements and instructions for installing the Azure PowerShell module.

1. In the **Requirements** section, use the **.NET Framework 4.7.2 or later** link to install **.NET Framework 4.8**.


#### Task 2: Install the Azure PowerShell modules
  
1. On MIA-CL1, start elevated Windows PowerShell window.

1. From the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** prompt, use the **Install-Module** to install the latest version of the Azure PowerShell module. 


#### Task 3: Connect to your Azure subscription
  
1. From the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** prompt, list all the available Azure PowerShell modules by running the **Get-Module** cmdlet.

    > **Note**: The output contains a list of a number of Azure-specific PowerShell modules, including Az.* modules and the Azure.Storage module.

1. Sign in to your Azure subscription with the Microsoft account that has the Owner role in the Azure subscription you intend to use for this lab by running the **Add-AzAccount** cmdlet: 

    > **Note**: The cmdlet returns the list of all Azure subscriptions associated with your Microsoft account.


#### Task 4: Use Azure PowerShell cmdlets
  
1. Back at the **Administrator: Windows PowerShell** prompt, retrieve the list of all Azure subscriptions associated with your Microsoft account by running the **Get-AzSubscription** cmdlet:

1. Select the target Azure subscription by running the **Select-AzSubscription** cmdlet, using the **Subscription Id** property returned by the **Get-AzSubscription** cmdlet.

      > **Note**: If you had multiple subscriptions, you would use this cmdlet to specify the Azure subscription you want to work with in the current PowerShell session.

1. Retrieve the types of Azure Resource Manager providers available in the target Azure subscription by running the **Get-AzResourceProvider**  cmdlet:

      > **Note**: The cmdlet lists each Azure Resource Provider, its registration state (the provider must be registered before you can use it), and the list of resource types you can create by referencing it.

1. Identify the list of resource types that are implemented by the Microsoft.Compute Azure Resource Manager resource provider (which includes Azure Virtual Machines) by running the **Get-AzResourceProvider** cmdlet with the **-ProviderNamespace** parameter.

1. Identify the list of resource types that are implemented by the Microsoft.Compute Azure Resource Manager resource provider in the East US Azure region by re-running the previous cmdlet but this time with the **-Location** parameter.

1. Close the Windows PowerShell.

1. Leave Microsoft Edge open.

> **Result**: Once you completed this exercise, you have successfully used the Azure PowerShell modules.


## Exercise 2: Using the Azure CLI
  
### Scenario
  
In this exercise, you will install and use the Azure CLI. 

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Install the Azure CLI

1. Connect to your Azure subscription by using the Azure CLI

1. Manage your Azure subscription by using the Azure CLI

1. Prepare for the next module


#### Task 1: Install the Azure CLI
  
1. On MIA-CL1, in Microsoft Edge, browse to [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?view=azure-cli-latest](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?view=azure-cli-latest) and use the **Download the MSI installer** link to install the latest version of Azure CLI.

1. Wait for the installation to complete.


#### Task 2: Connect to your Azure subscription by using the Azure CLI
  
1. On MIA-CL1, start Command Prompt as an administrator.

1. In the **Administrator: Command Prompt** window, use the **az** command to list Azure CLI commands.

1. In the **Administrator: Command Prompt** window, sign in to the target Azure subscription by using the **az login** command. 

1. When prompted, sign in with the Microsoft account that has the Owner role in the target Azure subscription. 

1. Back in the **Administrator: Command Prompt** window, note the JSON-formatted output displaying information about the current session, including the IDs of the subscriptions that your account is associated with. 


#### Task 3: Manage your Azure subscription by using the Azure CLI
  
1. In the **Administrator: Command Prompt** window, use the **az account list** command to list Azure subscriptions that your account is associated with. 

1. Use the **id** property displayed in the output of the preceding command as a parameter of the **az account set** command to specify the target Azure subscription you want to work with in the current Azure CLI session.

1. In the **Administrator: Command Prompt** window, use the **az provider list** command to retrieve the types of Azure Resource Manager providers available in your subscription.

    > **Note**: The output of the command contains each Azure Resource Provider available in your subscription and its registration state (the provider must be registered before you can use it).

1. In the **Administrator: Command Prompt** window, use the **az account list-locations** to list all the Azure regions available in the current subscription. 

1. In the **Administrator: Command Prompt** window, use the **az provider show** command with the **--namespace** parameter to identify the list of resource types that are implemented by the Microsoft.Compute provider (which includes Azure Virtual Machines) along with the list of locations where they are available.

1. Close the **Administrator: Command Prompt** window.


#### Task 4: Prepare for the next module
  
When you are finished with the lab, do not revert the virtual machines. Please keep all of the VMs running. The VMs in their current state are required for the next module.

> **Result**: Once you completed this exercise, you have used the Azure CLI.


**Question** 
You want to use the Azure CLI to manage classic resources. What must you do?
